							<p> Hello and welcome to my page, I'm David graduated in Computer Engineering at ISEP. Software development 
								always sparked me with curiosity, and technology always fascinated me. 
								Nowadays my purpose is to develop efficient and thoughtful solutions that 
								promote technological progression. </p>
							<p> During the time that I was studying, not only have I studied different 
								concepts related to software development, but also developed some “soft 
								skills” working with a team of colleagues. This type of experience allowed me to 
								develop team culture. </p>
							<p>
								Regarding my hobbies, currently I'm learning about photography specially using drones and so whenever I have 
								time you can find me exploring Portugal. Also I like playing video games with my friends. 
								For sports I play tennis and practice Krav Maga.

							<h3>ISEP – Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering 2016 - 2019</h3>
							<p>
								Whilst finishing my degree, I developed a project in the field of artificial 
								intelligence, consisting of a Recommendation System applied to municipal 
								websites. I took part in a development team in the company Wiremaze, which 
								allowed me to have my first impressions of the professional environment. It was 
								a very challenging task since it required deep study and understanding of 
								scientific concepts, that were applied to solve real-life problems. I finished this 
								project with 16 out of 20.
							</p>
							<h3>ISEP – Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence 2020 - Present</h3>
							<p>
								Entered the first edition of ISEP new Master course on Artificial 
								Intelligence in 2020. After one year of contact with technics of classification, 
								NLP, and agent systems, I’m currently writing my dissertation on dynamic 
								scheduling.

								<h3>Wiremaze Professional Internship 2019 - 2020</h3>
								<p>
									After finishing my degree, I joined Wiremaze on a professional 
									internship. I enrolled in a fullstack development position with Ruby on Rails as 
									well as customer support. I was responsible for some of the company’s products 
									such as WireMeet, WirePaper and providing live demos for the projects.

								</p>
								<h3>Critical Manufacturing 2020 - Present</h3>
								<p>
									I’ve joined Critical Manufacturing as a junior software engineer for the 
									customization team. I worked with C# .Net on the backend of the projects and 
									Angular TypeScript on the frontend. After a while, I started taking tasks related 
									to DevOps working on the Azure pipelines.
